  "content": "This project was completed in my Computer Science/Software Engineering class. The objective of it was to create a bug-free game that had level progression. My role in this project was a developer. My group and I created a game where two players had to compete to finish a maze. The mazes became more difficult as the game progressed and each one was completed. The two players gained points by collecting \"gems\" and finishing the mazes quickly. The winner is the player with the highest score after completing all of the mazes. We developed our brainstorming skills by coming up with ideas and using a flow chart to map them. We I also developed our logging and documentation skills by keeping a daily log of what happened each day and adding comments to our code explaining what each piece does. During this project, we had to overcome some limitations of Scratch. Scratch only allows one user at a time to be working on the same project. We solved this issue by creating copies of the game uses Scratch’s remix feature and working on different aspects and features of our game. We each coded in only certain sprites. At the end of the day, we assembled all of the code in our sprites together uses Scratch’s backpack feature. This allowed us to be more efficient as everyone in the group could contribute code to the game simultaneously.
