  "content": "This project was completed in my Principles of Engineering class. The objective of this project was to create a compound machine that performed a basic task. My role was building a 2nd class lever and helping out on documentation. My group created a machine that pours dog food into a bowl. The input was provided by spinning a wheel which acted like a crank for a simple gear train. The axle of the output gear in the gear train drove another wheel which had a string wrapped around it. This caused the wheel to pull the string when it was spun. The string ran over a pulley and connected to the far end of our lever, next to the cup of dog food. When the string was pulled, it rotated the lever 180 degrees and dumped the dog food into a bowl placed below the dropping point. During the project we ran into issues early on. We found that our small driver gear required a lot of rotations. Our solution was to replace it with a larger gear which ended up requiring us to rebuild the entire gear train because there wasnâ€™t enough space between the bottom of the machine and the 2nd gear.
