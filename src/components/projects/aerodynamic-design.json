  "content": "This project was completed in my Principles of Engineering class. The objective of this project was to design paper prototypes of projectiles to understand which designs produce projectiles that fly the furthest. Each of the members in my group, including myself, was responsible for designing two projectiles and creating prototypes using only paper products and tape. The projectiles were fitted onto a PVC pipe and launched with a pressure of 75 psi. My first design was a simple design with a long paper body, a short cone, and four curved fins at the end of it. This design was not very successful, it flew a measly 7 yards. However, after analyzing what went wrong and observing other people’s launches, I was able to design a rocket that performed much better. My second design flew 122 yards. I found that a tight fit around the PVC pipe was necessary to keep the air from escaping. I also found that smaller fins were better because they were a lot sturdier and did not flop and skew the flight path. I ended up using 3 fins instead of 4 since I learned that would decrease the amount of drag. Additionally, I learned that it is necessary to keep the projectile’s centroid, center of mass, at its center of geometry. On my first design, it was too far back so it flipped and fell straight down. On my second design, I used the combination of 3 smaller fins and a layered cone, made out of card stock, to bring more mass to the front of the projectile and push the centroid forward. This way the projectile would not flip over and instead, it would fly in a nice arc.
